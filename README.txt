TRIREME

Trireme is a main-memory OLTP engine testbed that implements four system
architectures and several popular concurrency control protocols in a single code
base. Using Trireme, we have done an experimental study [1] to understand

1) the impact of each system architecture on overall scalability
2) the interaction between system architure and concurrency control protocols
3) the pros and cons of new hybrid architectures that have been proposed to deal
with high-contention workloads
